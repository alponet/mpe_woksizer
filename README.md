# MPE Woksizer

MPE Woksizer will be a digital music instrument - a vocal synthesizer.

It is based on the principal functionality of a vocoder, processing audio and MIDI input to synthesize sound.
The MIDI Polyphonic Expression specification will be implemented to modulate the parameters of the sound generation
and the audio analysis.

Woksizer is the first device of my audio programming kitchen and the foundation for more delicious stuff to come.
