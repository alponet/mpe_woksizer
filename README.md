# MPE Woksizer

MPE Woksizer is a digital music instrument - a vocal synthesizer.

It is based on the principal functionality of a vocoder, processing audio and MIDI input to synthesize sound.
The MIDI Polyphonic Expression specification is implemented to modulate the parameters of the sound generation
and the audio analysis.

This project is no longer maintained.
